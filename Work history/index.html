       <li><h3>Target<br>08/2013-12/2013</h3></li>
       <p>This was my first job right out of Highschool. I was a cart attendant and
           front end relief for the cashiers. I also stocked shelves and kept the store tidy. This was my first
           opprutunity developing my customer service skills since I enteracted with customers daily.
           <li><h3>AT&T<br>12/2013-06/2016</h3></li>
           At AT&T I was responsible for opening and closing the store on time
           ,selling phones to customers, resolving customer issues, handling payments,and keeping the store clean.
           This job showed me what it meant to be a team player and how important it is 
           for everyone to be on the same page. This is also where I really mastered the craft of customer service 
           by making sure my clients were always satisfied with their service.
           <li><h3>Unifirst<br>06/2016-10/2016</h3></li>
           I worked at Unifirst in Bensalem PA for a short stint is a route jumper.
           This was a physically demanding job with unset hours. My job responsibilites
           were to load the truck, driver to customer locations, pick up dirty uniforms, floormats,terry clothes,
           and replace them with fresh versions. I was also responsible for trying to upsell clients to 
           more expensive products and try to convey the value of purchasing better products.
           We used the "good,better,best" approach which did bring some success.
           <li><h3>HP HOOD<br>10/2016-01/2019</h3></li>
           At HP HOOD I worked as a machine operator. My primary responsibilites were to fill the machine with raw
           product , make sure the machine was operating at company standards and to report any major
           issues to the maintenance department. I was also tasked with performing 
           minor preventative maintenance procedures such as , rebulding filler heads, replacing O-Rings and gaskets, 
           rebuilding product T where raw milk enters the filler machine. I was responsible for doing titration ticket
           by the hour on the hour to make sure receptacles were steril for raw ingredients to be stored in.
           <li><h3>Swift Transportation<br>02/2019-11/2019</h3></li>
           I was a national OTR driver for swift transportation for a little under a year. They gave me the 
           opprutunity to show that I was a trustworthy and responsible driver and a valued team player.
           My primary responsibilites were to pre-trip and post trip the truck, pick up and deliver freight in a safe and timely fasion,
           communicate with dispatch if there were any delays due to traffic or inclement weather and to report mechanical issues to the shop.
           Being a team player and excellent communicator were very important to this job and showed me that 
           communication is everything when it comes to being succesful in a team setting.
           <li><h3>Crete Carrier<br>11/2019-06/2023</h3></li>
           My responsibilites for crete carrier were the same as the ones outlined for Swift transportation. 
           The job duties were all the same however when I went to crete I specialized in Western Regional freight.
           This came with the added challange of extreme weather west of I-35. Common 
           weather occurances would be blizzards, snow squalls, tornados , high wind gusts, ice storms, heatwaves, white out conditions, 
           road closures due to accidents and sandstorms. 
           <li><h3>SRM Concrete<br>07/2023-09/2023</h3></li>
           I worked at SRM for a short stint  mixing concrete and delivering to job sites. Pre tripping and post tripping 
           the trucks was a regular part of the day along with making sure product was up to standards for our customers.
           While I was greatful for the opprutunity to work for SRM the equipment was in constant need 
           of repairs which forced me to seek employment elsewhere since it was no longer safe for me to work here.
           <li><h3>USPS<br>09/2023-current</h3></li>
           I currently work for the United states Postal Service as a rural carrier associate. 
           My job responsibilites are casing all mail, packages and accountable items, loading postal vehicle in a safe and effcient manner, 
           delivering mail in safe and timely. I also communicate with my customers on a day to day basis, because believe it or not 
           sometimes the mailman or lady is the only person some people see all day so we really 
           do make a difference to some people. Aside from that I also specialize in a route from time to time
           that deals specifically in local government mail , I:E, certified letters, registered letters, etc. 
           These pieces of mail are extremely important and takes an individual who can be trusted to make sure that
           these pieces of mail go exactly to where they are suppost to go, they often require signatures and witnessing of the individual
           reciving this sort of mail.
