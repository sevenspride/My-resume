<p>Hi my name is Patrick Lapinski, i'm 30 years old and have a whole bunch
    of work history under my belt. I've always found myself taking on new 
    projects and learning new skills so that I can lead a rich and 
    interesting life. Currently your're finding yourself here
    because I have applied for your place of work and this website is to
    show another new skill I am developing which would be front end development.
    This resume is my first project and an important one since it will show you my skills, work history and anything else a
    potential employer would want to know.
