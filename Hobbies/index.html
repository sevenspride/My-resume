    <h2>The meat and Potatoes</h2>
    <p> So this is where I know I can stand out and show my personality through the things
        that I know define me. I have a knack for picking up hobbies as a hobby in itself. I never find myself
        to be content with only learning and sticking with one thing. I enjoy learning new things, getting good at them
        and then building on top of them. Below you'll find all the things I can think of 
        off the top of my head.

<li><h2>Cigars</h2></li>
<p>Boy do I love cigars, from the awesome flavors to the excellent craftsmanship to the history
    of how they are made. You can get lost in collecting different types, to learning what different flavor profiles different wrapers have
    to just displaying them handsomly in your home in a beautiful humidor. This is by far one of my favorite pass times. On the surface it just looks like another vice to some people, but to the 
    more inclined they realize that there is a whole artistic beauty to the hobby, not to mention cigars are
    100% all natural with zero added chemcicals. So not only do I enjoy this hobby a lot , I also feel good about it.

<li><h2>WarHammer 40k</h2></li>
<p>If you know you know. Warhammer has a rich sci fi history and an even richer community, pun inteded cause these minis ain't cheap.
Not only is playing on the tabletop something I enjoy but painting them really lets me tap in and polish my attention to detail , from painting pauldrons just right to filling in eyes with a tiny brush, this really scratches that itch. I started collecting These 
when I was younger but really got in to it as an adult when I was able to afford them more often. 
</p>
<li><h2>Fishing</h2></li>
<p>
Fishing is near and dear to my heart because when I was a kid it was 
one of the things my father taught me when he had time from his busy work wife.
I remember cool summer mornings sitting in Cork creek park with my father and brothers fishing for 
rock bass under the bridge. Feeling that tug of a fish on the other 
end of the line was what really got me hooked on this hobby, now as an adult whenever I get free time 
from my busy work life I like to crack a few cold ones open and sit by
a nice body of water and go fishing. Its also really easy to get lost in collecting different
rods, lures, reels, lines, etc. If you're a glutten for buying accessories
fishing will really burn a hole in your pocket, but , it is fun.

<li><h2>OutDoors,Cooking, Arboring</h2></li>
<p>
Have you ever chopped wood? Have you ever felt the rush of a near death experience by chain sawing a tree
in the wind and seeing that it isn't falling the way you want it to? Yeah that's what 
gets me excited about arboring , its a rush that not many get to experience but the fruits of your labor
really pay off, not just from staying physically in shape, but from also having all the 
firewood you want. I mean jeeze wood is $10.20 a bundle at the time of this writing, who wants to pay that?
<br> 
<br>
Along with arboing using that wood to build a camp fire and cooking something over said fire is 
what I try to do at least twice a week. From cooking burgers to sausages to ribeyes, you catch my drift. This hobby really pairs great with the other
ones I listed above. A little bit of cigar smoking with a little bit of fishing to a little bit of sitting by a fire cooking some burgers
they all kind of synergize together.</p>
<li><h2>Surfing</h2></li>
<p>
So I picked up surfing when I moved to Florida in May. It's something I always wanted to try as a kid going 
to the Jersey shore, but the water was too cold and I was also deathly afraid of sharks as a kid.
But as an adult when I got the chance I decided to bite the bullet and give it a shot. At the start
it was a bit rocky and I found myself falling off a lot. But after a few weeks of trying I finally got the hang of it 
and now whenever the weather and ocean water are warm I take every opprutunity to try to improve
my surfing skills. One day i'd like to get good enough to catch big 6ft waves, but for now im content catching my little 3ft waves.
